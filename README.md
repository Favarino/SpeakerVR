# SpeakerVR
Two week solo virtual reality game. Based on the fear of public speaking. Your fear manifests itself as demons and you need to whip them away. Keep in mind they can go anywhere around you so remember to look behind. Whip works best with large sweeping motions as opposed to micro movements.
